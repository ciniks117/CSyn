This directory demonstrates the integration of RTAMT online monitors to MATLAB/Simulink.
The monitors are integrated by using the MATLAB Lever 2 S-Function online_monitor.m, which
is used to create a new S-Function simulink block online_monitor.
The main MATLAB script to start the simulation with the monitor is online_monitoring_demo.m.

The script can also be executed from the shell (Unix) with the following command:
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "run('<RTAMT_INSTALL_DIR>/rtamt/examples/online_monitors_matlab_simulink/on
line_monitoring_demo.m');quit;"
